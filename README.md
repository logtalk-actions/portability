# portability

Demo repo for running tests with multiple backends using a single workflow that uploads xUnit and code coverage reports per backend as build artifacts.

The source files are a copy of the [`aliases`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/aliases) example in the Logtalk distribution. The backends used are ECLiPSe and SWI-Prolog. See the [`testing_multiple_backends.yml.yml`](.github/workflows/testing_multiple_backends.yml.yml) workflow file for details.
